## My process

- Read any documentation
- Look at the designs in the different views
- Make sure you understand what is being asked
- Add style guid to CSS
- Build Semantic HTML framework based on visual inspection
- Start at top and work your way down with CSS matching the style guide and Figma measurements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to match the design even though the design is missing a piece. I'm able to fill in the blanks and make it work and match the design.
